//* GLOBAL VARIABLES
$g-viewport-type: max-width; //* It's used for mediaqueries; max-width (desktop first) or min-with (mobile first)

$g-row-class: f--row; //* The class used for the row
$g-row-remove-gutter-class: f--row--remove-gutter; //* The class used for the row without gutter. If that class doesn't exist, you can use the same one as for a normal row
$g-transition-duration: 0.3s; //* The duration of all hover transitions
$g-transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(
    0.2,
    0,
    0.38,
    0.9
); //* The function of all hover transitions (linear, ease, ease-in-ot...)

//* btn
$btn-padding: $g-measure $g-measure * 3; //* The padding for buttons that have space around them
$btn-icon-gap: $g-measure; //* The space between icon and text in buttons with icon
$btn-full-width-breakpoint: 580px; //* The breakpoint at which we want buttons with padding should either expand to 100% width of the parent or stop being 100% width. If you never want them to be 100% width, you can omit this variable.

//* pill
$pill-padding: $g-measure $g-measure * 2; //* The padding for pills that have space around them

//* form fields
$form-margin-bottom: $g-measure * 3; //* The margin-bottom for form fields

//* card
$card-spaces-breakpoint: 810px; //* The breakpoint at which the spacing changes for all cards
$card-item-list-gap: $g-measure; //* The space between all possible lists in cards. Possible lists refer to the last text element of all cards containing more than one text element.

$cta-inside-container-padding: $g-measure * 15 $g-measure * 10; //* The padding for the CTAs when the 'container' is set to 'no'. This variable can be a single number, a list of numbers, a class, or a list of classes
$cta-inside-container-padding-responsive: $g-measure * 10 $g-measure * 7; //* The padding for the CTAs when the 'container' is set to 'no' from the breakpoint specified in $cta-spaces-breakpoint onward
$cta-outside-container-padding-y: $g-measure * 20; //* The top and bottom padding for the CTAs when the 'container' is set to 'yes'. This must be a single number

//* layout
$layout-spaces-breakpoint: 810px; //* The breakpoint at which the spacing changes for all layouts
$layout-item-list-gap: $g-measure $g-measure * 2; //* The space between all possible lists in layouts.
